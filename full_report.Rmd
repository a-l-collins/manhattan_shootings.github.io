## **Motivation**

Gun violence is a persistent public health crisis in the United States. In New York City, for example, we had the (Midtown Manhattan mass shooting)[https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/03/us/manhattan-shooting-timeline-911-calls] in July 2025. It showed us that even our busiest, most protected neighborhoods are impacted by gun violence. We set out to perform a descriptive exploration of socioeconomic, geographic, and temporal factors that are potentially positively or negatively associated with firearm shootings in Manhattan, NYC.

## **Questions**

Questions we had about patterns that can be found in Manhattan shootings were:

1. Does lighting in the area from street lamps influence shooting rates?
1. Does time of day influence shooting rates?
1. Does time of year and/or the COVID-19 pandemic influence shooting rates?
1. How do the social/environmental conditions of each region influence shooting rates?
1. Does location influence shooting rates?
1. Does victim gender influence shooting rates?
1. Do these patterns change based on whether the shooting had been fatal?

We see a trend in shootings where they tend to occur at night, during the weekend, and during periods of the year (the winter and the summer) when vacations/time off work are more likely to occur. This indicates that, temporally, shootings are far more likely to occur outside of standard working hours (9am - 5pm on weekdays), and that trends in these areas are based on when individuals are either occupied or when they have free time. It is likely that the temporal pattern of shootings is the result, and not the cause, of factors that influence whether a shooting takes place. The spike in shootings during the COVID-19 pandemic supports this theory, as there was an increase both in those who became unemployed and those who started working from home/saw their working hours reduced, causing an increase both in free time and in the shooting rate. Future testing to determine whether this theory is accurate could focus on the interpersonal element of shootings and in what circumstances they took place, and whether those circumstances are connected to that individual's free time.
