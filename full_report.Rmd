## **Motivation**

Gun violence is a persistent public health crisis in the United States. In New York City, for example, we had the (Midtown Manhattan mass shooting)[https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/03/us/manhattan-shooting-timeline-911-calls] in July 2025. It showed us that even our busiest, most protected neighborhoods are impacted by gun violence. We set out to perform a descriptive exploration of socioeconomic, geographic, and temporal factors that are potentially positively or negatively associated with firearm shootings in Manhattan, NYC.

## **Questions**

Questions we had about patterns that can be found in Manhattan shootings were:

1. Does lighting in the area from street lamps influence shooting rates?
1. Does time of day influence shooting rates?
1. Does time of year and/or the COVID-19 pandemic influence shooting rates?
1. How do the social/environmental conditions of each region influence shooting rates?
1. Does location influence shooting rates?
1. Does victim gender influence shooting rates?
1. Do these patterns change based on whether the shooting had been fatal?

## **Discussion**

### *Fatal shooting discussion*

At the geographic level, fatality proportions were remarkably consistent across boroughs, ranging only from 0.18 to 0.21. This suggests that location does not strongly shape whether a shooting becomes fatal, even though total shooting counts differ widely across areas.

At the individual level, the regression results show clearer differences. Younger victims have significantly lower odds of death, while older victims have higher odds. Race also showed meaningful variation, with Black and Other-race victims having lower odds of fatality compared with White victims. Although these results appear to contrast with widely documented patterns in firearm mortality, this discrepancy may reflect the fact that our analysis focuses exclusively on fatal shooting incidents. The dataset may include deaths such as suicides, which could shift the distribution of fatal outcomes and contribute to the higher odds observed among White victims. Victim sex did not influence fatality risk.

Taken together, these findings indicate that fatal outcomes vary more by individual characteristics than by geography.

### *Unlit street lamps discussion*

Our analyses consistently show that census tracts with more unlit street lights experience higher shooting rates. This association appeared in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models and remained significant during both daytime and nighttime, with slightly stronger effects at night. Spatial patterns further support this relationship, as areas with higher counts of unlit lights also showed greater concentrations of shootings. Although the effect size per unlit light is modest, accumulated lighting deficiencies within neighborhoods may meaningfully elevate shooting risk. These findings suggest that improving street-lighting infrastructure may be a practical component of strategies aimed at reducing community violence.

### *Time discussion*

We see a trend in shootings where they tend to occur at night, during the weekend, and during periods of the year (the winter and the summer) when vacations/time off work are more likely to occur. This indicates that, temporally, shootings are far more likely to occur outside of standard working hours (9am - 5pm on weekdays), and that trends in these areas are based on when individuals are either occupied or when they have free time. It is likely that the temporal pattern of shootings is the result, and not the cause, of factors that influence whether a shooting takes place. The spike in shootings during the COVID-19 pandemic supports this theory, as there was an increase both in those who became unemployed and those who started working from home/saw their working hours reduced, causing an increase both in free time and in the shooting rate. Future testing to determine whether this theory is accurate could focus on the interpersonal element of shootings and in what circumstances they took place, and whether those circumstances are connected to that individual's free time.
